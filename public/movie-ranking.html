    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jim</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>The Lion King (1994)</h3>
    <p>
        This was one of my favourite childhood movies.
        And it still does trigger some great childhood
        memories, which can all be summarized into two
        words - 'Hakuna matata'.
    </p>
    <h3>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</h3>
    <p>
        I really loved the Terminator and the fight 
        scenes in the movie. It really made me dream 
        of building machines that could fight and 
        protect others.
    </p>
    <h3>Spider-Man (2002)</h3>
    <p>
        I watched this movie over and over again. 
        Just being amazed at how Spider-Man would
        always swoop in and save the day. I also
        loved the songs and music played within 
        the movie with lots of excitement.
